# `observal freeze` and `observal unfreeze`

Control local consent for automatic **registry agent/component** updates. These commands never install or update an item themselves and do not affect `observal self` (CLI upgrades). Update checks and manual upgrades still work while frozen. Auto-updating defaults to **frozen** for everyone.

> **Rollout status:** Startup is notice-only by default. After `observal unfreeze`, narrowly eligible Pi user agents, Pi registry-direct user skills with an unchanged owned file set, and Claude Code user-agent profiles can be updated through their normal installers. Each needs known unpinned intent, an approved exact release, and unchanged, unshared owned files. A stopped install restores original bytes and modes only if metadata and the old or planned file state can still be proved; ambiguous results retain a private backup and pending notice. Project installs and other shapes remain manual. Leave production profiles frozen until this pilot has passed review and supported-environment CI. `unfreeze` is the sole user-level opt-in.

```bash
observal unfreeze                          # Opt in for eligible personal installs
observal freeze                            # Turn off automatic installs
observal unfreeze --project --dir ./repo    # Also permit changes in this project
observal freeze --project --dir ./repo      # Revoke just this project's grant
observal freeze --output json
```

These commands require a locally signed-in account and configured registry URL, but make no network request. Preferences live in `~/.observal/auto-update-policy.json`, separate from the machine's `lockfile.json` and the project's committed `observal.lock`. Consent is keyed by **both the configured registry and the locally authenticated account ID**. Signing out, switching accounts, or overriding the stored token with an environment token cannot inherit another account's grant. Environment-only credentials cannot opt in until a matching local login. Legacy registry-only consent is discarded on the first policy change; run `observal unfreeze` again to grant consent to the current account. Project consent is local to this account and machine and applies **only** to the resolved project root, not child projects or teammates' checkouts. Project auto-updates additionally require the global `unfreeze`. A project grant can cause changes to files and `observal.lock` once the project updater is implemented: review and commit diffs deliberately.

`--dir` requires `--project`; without `--dir`, `--project` uses the current directory. Repeating either command is safe. A malformed or unsupported policy disables automatic updates and is not overwritten silently (legacy unscoped v1 grants are dropped rather than migrated). If an install is in progress, `freeze` waits for the shared per-registry gate: an install may complete before it returns, but a successful `freeze` prevents any new automatic install afterward. If waiting times out, the command fails instead of claiming it froze updates.

JSON results contain `registry`, `scope` (`user` or `project`), `project` (resolved path or `null`), `auto_update` (grant in this scope), and `effective` (after global policy). No token is emitted. Exit codes follow the [CLI error contract](README.md#exit-codes): 3 for missing registry or local account, 6 for busy gate, 7 for malformed policy or invalid project, 4 for permission errors, and 9 for other filesystem failures.

See [the startup update plan](../auto-update-spec.md) for eligibility rules and rollout stages, and [`observal outdated`](outdated.md) to check versions manually.
