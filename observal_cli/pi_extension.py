"""Install/version-check logic for the bundled Pi telemetry extension.

Two installation modes coexist:
  - npm: the user has `npm:observal-pi[@version]` configured in
    ~/.pi/agent/settings.json. Observal never writes to this path; it only
    reports when a pinned version is older than the installed CLI.
  - local: Observal writes the canonical extension straight to
    ~/.pi/agent/extensions/observal.ts, tracked by an adjacent
    .observal-extension.json manifest recording the CLI version it was
    installed from. A file at that path with no matching manifest is
    either migrated (if it carries Observal's own header, i.e. it was
    installed by a CLI predating this tracking) or treated as unmanaged
    and never overwritten.

npm takes priority: if it's configured (even if not yet downloaded by Pi),
Observal never installs locally. It does still look at the local path, because
a leftover observal.ts there is loaded by Pi alongside the npm package and
sends every session twice.

Shared by `observal doctor` (interactive check/patch/cleanup) and the
automatic post-login install in cmd_auth.py.
